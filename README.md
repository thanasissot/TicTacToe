# TicTacToe
This my v.01 of a Tic Tac Toe game using python and the pygame library.
Its a GUI application
I know its a little spaghetti code
My next steps include:
  - the app awaits for a new click to reset after a draw or win, fix this
  - add a reset score button
  - give the option to the players to add their name
  - give a player the option to backtrack one move (etc an accidental click)

Changes accomplished since post:
  - adding a starting screen, and a "New Game" button
  - added music
